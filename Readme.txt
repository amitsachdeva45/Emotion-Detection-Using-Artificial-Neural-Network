In testing phase: Machine will detect your emotions and give result in percentage (def testSet()).
Random pics(Inside Sad and Funny folder) are shown during testing phase to change emotions according to sample photos

Libraries Used: Numpy, OpenCV

Language: Python

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Avoid Sunlight while running project

Project File: finalCodeUsingRandomPhotoMethod.py

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Change path According to Desktop

1) Used CascadeClassifier for face detection
2) Funny and Sad Folder for testing 
3) S200 testing photos saved during testing
4) nof.txt to check which new folder should be created to store testing photos.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: WEBCAM is required and LOOK directly into webcam for better results.
